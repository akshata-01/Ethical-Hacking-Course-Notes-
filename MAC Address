# Ethical-Hacking-Course-Notes-

This is a repo for my notes on ethical hacking. 

### MAC Address 
 - Permanent, Physical, Unique 
 - Used to identify devices 
 
### Why would you change it? 
 - Impersonate other devices
 - Bypass filters
 - Increase anonymity 
 - ifconfig
 - There are multiple types of interfaces, eg: wlan, eth 
 
 ### Manually changing MAC address [You may need to use sudo ]
  - ifconfig eth0 down #Disabling interface 
  - ifconfig eth0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55  #Modify option of ether  | Make sure it's 12 characters & separated with : 
  - ifconfig eth0 up #enabling the interface 
  - ifconfig #To check 
### PYTHON
  - SUBPROCESS: Using a module to execute system commands | call function 
  - OS dependent 
    - SYNTAX 
    - import subprocess 
    - subprocess.call("COMMAND that you wanna run", shell=True)
  - Call function
  - Runs in the foreground 
  - Waits for the command to finish executing (This is what we want so the system waits for the change of MAC address and then does other stuff)

### Shortcuts Used 
Ctrl + d to duplicate the same line in the editor
